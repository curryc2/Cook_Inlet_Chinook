Anchor,2003,,13273,,13273,Weir count,Chinook salmon were monitored in the mainstem Anchor River below the confluence of the North/South forks using DIDSON sonar and/or resistance board weir and/or instream video during 2003–2012. Monitoring occurred throughout the run; except in 2003; when an expansion was applied. Aerial surveys also conducted during previous years; but they were found to be unreliable (Kerkvliet et al. 2016) so we did not include them in our analysis.,Otis et al. 2016,30

Anchor,2013,,4388,,4388,Weir count,A series of floods rendered the mainstem Anchor River site unsuitable for escapement monitoring.
