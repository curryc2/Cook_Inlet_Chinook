Anchor,2003,,13273,,13273,Weir,Weir count,Chinook salmon were monitored in the mainstem Anchor River below the confluence of the North/South forks using DIDSON sonar and/or resistance board weir and/or instream video during 2003–2012. Monitoring occurred throughout the run; except in 2003; when an expansion was applied. Aerial surveys also conducted during previous years; but they were found to be unreliable (Kerkvliet et al. 2016) so we did not include them in our analysis.,Otis et al. 2016,30
